# Hi there! ✨

I'm [rameerez](https://twitter.com/rameerez) and I’ve been creating digital products for the past few years.

I’m now working on building [PromptHero](https://prompthero.com). I've also created [Hustl](https://gohustl.co/) and [Edit](https://goedit.me/), among [others](https://rameerez.com/projects)

As for tech stack, I'm a Ruby on Rails guy; but I also love Python for data science / ml.

Lately I've been making a few OSS 💎 Ruby gems:
 - [✅ `allgood`](https://github.com/rameerez/allgood) - Health check page for your Rails app
 - [💸 `profitable`](https://github.com/rameerez/profitable) – MRR dashboard for your [`pay`](https://github.com/pay-rails/pay)-powered Rails SaaS
 - [📍 `trackdown`](https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown) – Geolocate IPs easily (MaxMind BYOK)
 - [👣 `footprinted`](https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted) – Track geolocated user activity
 - [🐌 `slugifiable`](https://github.com/rameerez/slugifiable) – Generate SEO-friendly slugs
 - [🗑️ `nondisposable`](https://github.com/rameerez/nondisposable) – Block disposable emails signups
