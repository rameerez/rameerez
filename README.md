# Hi there! ✨

My name is Javi, but most people know me by my screen name [rameerez](https://twitter.com/rameerez).

I’m a solo developer and I’ve been building digital products for the past few years.

I’m the creator of [Guard](https://useguard.com/), [Hustl](https://gohustl.co/) and [Edit](https://goedit.me/), among [others](https://rameerez.com/projects).

### Tech stack 👨‍💻

I've built projects using React, Swift, Ruby on Rails, Node, PHP, Python... I'm pretty tech-agnostic when it comes to building things. I'll use whatever gets the job done best, as fast as possible. Most of my work is in private repos, so don't expect to see much here apart from exciting side projects!
